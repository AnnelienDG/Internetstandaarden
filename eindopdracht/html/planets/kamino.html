        <h2>ABOUT KAMINO</h2>
        <p>Kamino, called Big Stormy by some clone troopers, also known as the Planet of Storms, was the watery world where the Clone Army of the Galactic Republic was created, as well as the Kamino Home Fleet. It was inhabited by a race of tall, elegant beings called the Kaminoans, who kept to themselves and were known for their cloning technology. Kamino was located just south of the Rishi Maze, and was governed by the Ruling Council, headed by the Prime Minister.</p>
        <p>Its savage storms and powerful lightning bursts could be seen vaguely through its relatively thick atmosphere. Although technically part of Wild Space region in the galaxy, it is sometimes referred to as an extra-galactic planet due to its system being located between the main galaxy and the Rishi Maze dwarf galaxy.</p>
