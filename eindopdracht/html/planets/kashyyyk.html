        <h2>ABOUT KASHYYYK</h2>
        <p>Kashyyyk (occasionally spelled Kashyk) was a wroshyr tree-covered planet located in the southwestern quadrant of the galaxy and the homeworld of the Wookiee species. It was a member of the Galactic Republic and after the Clone Wars endured enslavement under the Galactic Empire. The planet was classified by the Empire as G5-623.</p>
        <p>Kashyyyk was a temperate jungle planet orbiting around a single star located in the Mytaranor sector of the Mid Rim, and had a complement of three moons. Covered in wroshyr trees, it served as homeworld to the Wookiee species. Native fauna such as Can-cells would influence the design of starships by the Wookiee inhabitants, while great cities such as Kachirho would be built into the planet's trees.</p>
        <p>The crash site of the prison ship Ashmead's Lock was known as the Black Forest. Wookiees believed that the Black Forest was cursed and haunted by bad spirits. By 5 ABY, sections of Kashyyyk's forests had been deforested and several rivers had been drained. The Empire also established undersea mining platforms. Mount Arayakyak was once a rainforest orchard known as the Cultivating Talon, which provided Wookiees with fruits such as shi-shok. By the Age of the Empire, it had been defoliated by a poisonous black mold.</p>
